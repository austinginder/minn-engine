# The WordPress runtime

How plugin code written for WordPress runs on the engine, unmodified. Code:
`public/minn/src/Minn/Runtime/` (the services) and `public/minn/wp-api/` (the
procedural facade plugins call). Suites: `tests/hooks.test.php` (112),
`tests/api.test.php` (1,044), `tests/runtime.test.php` (13).

## The shape

Plugins are PHP that calls WordPress functions and hooks into lifecycle
actions. The engine provides those functions itself, as thin delegations into
its own classes, and fires the actions from its own request path. Nothing
here is WordPress code: every function is written from
`contracts/api/*.json` (the interface, extracted by reflection) and
`contracts/fixtures/api/*.json` (behaviour, captured by probe batteries run on
the reference). Section 5 of `docs/vision.md` has the legal reasoning.

| Piece | Where | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `Runtime\Hooks` | `src/Minn/Runtime/Hooks.php` | the hook registry: add/remove/has, filter/action, the current-filter stack, did counts, the `all` hook |
| `Runtime\Runtime` | `src/Minn/Runtime/Runtime.php` | one per request: db, site, request, reader, capabilities, engine and site paths; loads the facade, defines the constants, holds plugin-visible state |
| `Runtime\Options` | | options as PHP values (decoded without `unserialize()`, objects become `stdClass`), cached for the request so a value written then read keeps its type |
| `Runtime\ObjectCache`, `Runtime\Shortcodes`, `Runtime\Assets` | | the per-request object cache; the shortcode registry and expansion; the script/style registry |
| `Runtime\Constants` | | the fixed constants from `data/constants.json` (captured) plus the per-site ones computed here; never overrides wp-config.php |
| `Runtime\Symbols` | | the static symbol read that gates loading (below) |
| `Runtime\Plugins` | | loads mu-plugins then `active_plugins`, fires the lifecycle |
| `wp-api/*.php` | | the facade: `hooks`, `load`, `option`, `plugin`, `l10n`, `formatting`, `kses`, `link-template`, `user`, `meta`, `shortcodes`, `pluggable`, `theme`, `functions`, `post`, `script-loader`, `admin`, `customize`; `classes/` holds `WP_Error`, `WP_User`, `WP_Role`/`WP_Roles`, `WP_Post`, `WP_Theme`, `WP_Screen`, `WP_Scripts`/`WP_Styles`, `NOOP_Translations`; `defaults/filters.php` holds the reference's own registrations |
| `data/constants.json`, `data/kses.json`, `data/mime.json` | | captured tables: constants, the kses allowlists and entity names, the mime map |

The facade is deliberately procedural (global functions, loose types, no
`declare(strict_types)`): it is the interface plugins were written against.
`docs/style.md` governs `src/Minn/`; the facade is outside it and its own
rules are: every function's signature matches the inventory (the suite
checks all of them), every behaviour is pinned by a probe row, no WordPress
source is ever consulted.

## Loading

`Runtime::boot()` runs in `Engine::respond()` after the reader is known and
before the engine's own extensions register. Then `Plugins::load()`:

1. every `wp-content/mu-plugins/*.php`, alphabetically, then `muplugins_loaded`
2. every entry of `active_plugins`, in stored order, then `plugins_loaded`,
   `sanitize_comment_cookies`, `setup_theme`, `after_setup_theme`, `init`,
   `wp_loaded` (the order the reference fires them; `contracts/api/lifecycle.json`)

`minn-admin/minn-admin.php` is never loaded as code: the engine answers that
plugin itself. Each file is included in a clean scope, once. A plugin that
throws while loading is logged and skipped.

**The symbol gate.** Before a plugin folder is included, `Runtime\Symbols`
tokenises every PHP file in it and lists the global functions it calls and
the classes it instantiates, extends, or reads statically, minus what the
plugin itself declares and what it guards with `function_exists()` /
`class_exists()`. If anything in that list is not provided by the runtime,
the plugin is not loaded and the list is recorded (`Plugins::skipped()`).
The read is cached in the `minn_runtime_symbols` option, keyed by the
folder's newest modification time. This is what keeps a site rendering when
a plugin needs a piece of the runtime that does not exist yet, and it is the
list the next piece of runtime is built from.
`MINN_SITE_ROOT=<root> php tests/tools/runtime-report.php` prints the
per-plugin verdict for any site.

**Stand-ins step aside.** An engine extension whose manifest `replaces` a
plugin file registers only while that plugin is not running as code.

## The lifecycle on a themed page

`PageRenderer` fires `template_redirect` before rendering, `wp_head` in the
head, `wp_footer` before `</body>`, and applies `body_class`; post content
and feed content run the runtime's shortcodes and then the `the_content`
filter after the engine's own pipeline (blocks, texturize, autop, the
extension seams). `shutdown` fires from a PHP shutdown function.

Inside `wp_head` the reference's own registrations run at their priorities:
`wp_enqueue_scripts` at 1, `wp_print_styles` at 8, `wp_print_head_scripts`
at 9; inside `wp_footer`, `_wp_footer_scripts` at 20. The engine's own
stylesheets (blocks.css, the global styles, the theme's style.css) print
from a callback at `wp_head` priority 8 registered after `wp_print_styles`,
so plugin styles come first and a plugin's `wp_head` output at a lower
priority precedes them, as on the reference.

**Not in the defaults, by design:** the reference's `the_content` /
`the_title` / `the_excerpt` chains (`wptexturize`, `wpautop`, `do_blocks`,
`do_shortcode`, …). That pipeline is the engine's own, so `the_content` fires
on the rendered HTML for plugin callbacks only. A plugin hooking
`the_content` below priority 10 to see raw content sees rendered content
instead. Known gap.

## Facts the probes settled

- **Hooks** (`contracts/fixtures/api/hooks.json`): callbacks run by
  ascending priority then insertion; one added at a higher priority during
  a run takes part in that run, one added at the current or a lower
  priority waits; one removed before its turn is skipped; `has_filter`
  with a callback returns its lowest priority; string and int priorities
  share a bucket; `'Class::m'` and `['Class', 'm']` are one callback; the
  `all` hook sees every firing with the name first and every argument
  regardless of `accepted_args`; `did_action` and `did_filter` count
  separately; nested application of the same hook is independent.
- **Options**: a missing option is `false`; `default_option_{name}` wins
  over the passed default; `pre_option_{name}` short-circuits; a written
  value keeps its PHP type when read again in the same request (`5` stays
  int, `false` stays false, `null` reads back as `''`); `update_option`
  returns false when nothing changed; a transient with no expiry has no
  timeout row; an expired transient is deleted on read.
- **Escaping**: `esc_html` and `esc_attr` are identical, keep known named
  entities and numeric references, and encode unknown ones (`&bogus;` →
  `&amp;bogus;`); `esc_textarea` double-encodes; `esc_js` strips
  backslashes, escapes quotes, and turns newlines into `\n`; `esc_url`
  prepends `http://` to a bare host, refuses unknown schemes and
  `javascript:`/`data:`, encodes `&` as `&#038;` and `'` as `&#039;` in the
  display context only, and strips `"`, `<`, `>`, and NUL.
- **Sanitising**: `sanitize_text_field` escapes a `<` that starts a
  tag-looking run, strips tags with their script/style bodies, collapses
  whitespace, and removes percent-encoded octets; `sanitize_title` runs
  through the `sanitize_title` filter, where the default
  `sanitize_title_with_dashes` lives (so a plugin can remove it);
  `sanitize_email` keeps the local part's case and drops brackets.
- **kses**: stray `<` and `>` in text become entities; `<script>` loses its
  tags but keeps its text; `style` keeps only the listed properties (the
  engine's own `Support\Kses`); the allowed-tag table is
  `data/kses.json`, captured from `wp_kses_allowed_html('post')`; numeric
  entities normalise to at least three digits (`&#65;` → `&#065;`).
- **URLs**: `home_url`/`site_url` honour `http`, `https`, and `relative`;
  `admin_url` is https when the stored siteurl is (`FORCE_SSL_ADMIN` is
  defined true then); `content_url`, `plugins_url`, and the theme URIs take
  the request's scheme; `plugins_url()` with an absolute URL as the path
  appends it anyway; a script's relative `src` is prefixed with the stored
  siteurl verbatim (`rel/a.js` becomes `…localhostrel/a.js`, as on the
  reference); `add_query_arg` encodes keys and leaves values raw. The dev
  environment's helper mu-plugin rewrites `home`/`siteurl`; the probe
  removes its filters on both stacks first.
- **Users**: `WP_User->data` carries the ten user columns; `roles` and
  `allcaps` come from the capabilities meta over the site's roles; an
  anonymous `WP_User` answers `false` for unknown properties; `is_super_admin`
  is `delete_users`; `current_user_can('exist')` is true for everyone.
- **Shortcodes**: `[tag/]` gives an empty attribute array, `[[tag]]` is the
  literal, the first `[/tag]` closes and content is not re-expanded,
  `shortcode_parse_atts` keys bare words and quoted values by position.
- **Assets** (`contracts/fixtures/api/admin.json`): a script tag is
  `<script id="{h}-js" src="{src}"></script>` (id first); `ver=false` adds
  the reference version, `null` adds nothing; localized data prints in
  `{h}-js-extra` with every scalar cast to string (`5` → `"5"`, `false` →
  `""`); inline code prints in `{h}-js-before`/`-after` and `{h}-inline-css`;
  under `WP_DEBUG` each inline block ends with a `sourceURL` comment
  (unverified with `WP_DEBUG` off); `defer` prints `data-wp-strategy="defer"
  defer`, `async` prints `async data-wp-strategy="async"`; registering a
  handle twice is refused.
- **Admin registrations**: `add_menu_page` returns `toplevel_page_{slug}`
  and records `[menu_title, cap, slug, page_title, 'menu-top …', hook,
  icon]` in `$menu`; `add_submenu_page` and the `add_*_page` wrappers
  return false (and record nothing) when the current user lacks the
  capability; hook names for the core parents are the reference's
  (`settings_page_{slug}`, `appearance_page_{slug}`, …);
  `remove_menu_page` returns the row; `add_meta_box` stores
  `{id, title, callback, args}` and `remove_meta_box` stores `false`;
  `wp_add_dashboard_widget` needs a current screen; the Settings API
  markup (`settings_fields`, `do_settings_sections`, `settings_errors`,
  `get_submit_button`) is pinned row by row.

## What a plugin cannot do yet

Listed in the order real plugins ask for it (from `runtime-report.php` on the
dogfood site): `register_block_type` and dynamic block rendering through a
plugin callback; the conditional tags and `WP_Query`; `register_post_type`
and taxonomies; `register_rest_route`; the media functions
(`wp_get_attachment_image`, sizes, the image editor); `wp_remote_*`; the
admin host that renders the recorded menus, settings pages, and meta boxes;
cron hooks; `.mo` translations; widgets and the customizer (the classes
exist so plugins load; nothing is served).
